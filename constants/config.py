SCHEDULE_INTRO_MESSAGE = "Welcome to the schedule channel. To schedule an operation you can use the **`/operation`** command (or **`/bop`**) and follow the instructions through DMs. For a workshop use **`/workshop`** or **`/ws`** and for a generic event use **`/event`**. If you haven't set a preferred time zone yet you will be prompted to do so when you schedule any kind of event. If you want to set, change or delete your time zone preference you can do so with the **`/changetimezone`** command.\n\nYou can use the colored strip to the left of each event to quickly know its type at a glance. The colors are:\nðŸŸ© Operation `/operation` or `/bop`\nðŸŸ¦ Workshop `/workshop` or `/ws`\nðŸŸ¨ Event `/event`\n\nIf you have any features suggestions or encounter any bugs, please contact {0} and/or {1}."
