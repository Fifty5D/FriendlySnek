The code for the official Friendly Snek bot (which lives on the Sigma Security Group discord server) is the responsibility of Adrian (discord username ADRIAN#1337).
Only Adrian may accept changes into the official bot's code as well as in the official github repository (https://github.com/Sigma-Security-Group/FriendlySnek).
Anyone can fork or copy any part of the code (or the entire code) without the need to mention Adrian or Sigma Security Group.
The copied code can be used for any purpose whatsoever (provided it is legal of course).

If one day, for whatever reason, Adrian leaves Sigma Security Group, the code and the repository can be used however Sigma Surity Group's Staff decides.
However, the Friendly Snek bot would have to be replaced by another bot (potentially using the exact same code and the exact same name and profile picture) as the current Friendly Snek bot runs on one of Adrian's personal servers.

TL;DR Don't modify the official code, but feel free to copy any of it without restrictions. If Adrian ever leaves, feel free to keep using the code.
